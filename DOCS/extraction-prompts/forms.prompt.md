# Forms (Angular FormGroups/FormControls) Interrogation Prompt

# DNA-Level Extraction Instructions

**You are extracting the full DNA of all Angular forms (FormGroups, FormControls, FormArrays) in the component for rehydration in a modern Nx/Angular workspace.**

For each form, form group, and form control:
- Identify and list all FormGroups, FormControls, and FormArrays (with full code and their structure)
- Show how each form is initialized, patched, and validated (with all code for initialization, patchValue, get, setValue, validators, etc.)
- Map each form field to its corresponding model property, if possible
- Document all usages of patchValue, get, setValue, and any dynamic form logic (with code and rationale)
- Explain the purpose and business logic behind each form and field (with mapping to requirements)
- Include diagrams or tables for form structure, field relationships, and validation if possible
- Explicitly call out any anti-patterns, legacy artifacts, or edge cases

**Output Format:**
- Use markdown with clear headings, bullet points, and code blocks for all code and configuration samples.
- All file references must use complete relative paths from the workspace root.
- Include diagrams, tables, and rationale sections as appropriate.
- More detail is better: err on the side of including too much rather than too little.
