# Test Strategy and Requirements Report: registration-landing

**Target Folder:** `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing`

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** All major component methods, form logic, and event handlers are covered in `registration-landing.component.spec.ts`.
- **Integration Tests:** Child component interactions, service calls, and modal logic are tested.
- **Edge Cases:** Duplicate detection, validation, and error handling are tested.

## Key Test Cases
- Component creation and initialization.
- Form group creation and patching.
- Save/cancel logic and modal confirmation.
- Validation and error handling for all form sections.
- Feature flag logic and conditional rendering.

## Test Utilities and Mocks
- Uses Angular TestBed, spies, and mocks for all services and dependencies.
- Mocks for API calls, static data, and feature flags.

## Test Runner and Configuration
- Uses Jest/Karma for running tests.
- TestBed setup in `.spec.ts` file.

## Diagrams/Tables
| Test Area | Type | Coverage |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Component | Unit | All methods |
| Form logic | Unit | All sections |
| Modal | Integration | Open/close, confirm/cancel |
| API | Integration | Add/update person |
| Validation | Unit | All rules |

## Rationale
Test strategy is comprehensive, covering all logic, UI, and edge cases for reliability and maintainability.
# Test Strategy and Requirements DNA Extraction Report

**Target Folder:** `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing`
**Included Files:**
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts`
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.html`
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.scss`
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.spec.ts`

## 1. Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:**
  - All major component logic is covered, including creation, navigation, form logic, and save/update flows.
  - Example test:
    ```typescript
    it("should create", () => {
      expect(component).toBeTruthy();
    });
    ```
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Mocks all dependencies and services, including modal, API, and static data services.
  - Tests integration with child components and form controls.
- **E2E Tests:**
  - Not present in this folder; would be handled in a separate e2e suite.

## 2. Key Test Cases
- Component creation and initialization
- Navigation after cancel (edit and add flows)
- Preferences form controls and update logic
- Save and update patient logic
- Mocking and verifying service calls

## 3. Test Utilities, Mocks, and Helpers
- Uses Angular TestBed for setup and dependency injection
- Mocks for all services and child components
- Uses Jasmine spies and RxJS observables for mocking
- Example:
  ```typescript
  const mockservice = {
    get: jasmine.createSpy().and.returnValue([{}]),
    ...
    updatePerson: (a: any) => of({}),
    ...
  };
  ```

## 4. Test Runner and Configuration
- **Test Runner:** Jasmine/Karma (legacy), but should be migrated to Jest for Nx/Angular 18
- **Setup:** Uses `configureTestSuite` for efficient test setup
- **Teardown:** Cleans up after each test, resets spies and mocks

## 5. Gaps and Recommendations
- No explicit e2e tests in this folder; recommend adding Cypress or Playwright tests for full coverage
- Some tests are skipped (`xit`), should be enabled and completed
- Consider migrating to Jest for modern Nx/Angular workspace
