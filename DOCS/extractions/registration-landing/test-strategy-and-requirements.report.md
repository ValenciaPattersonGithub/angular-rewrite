# Test Strategy and Requirements DNA Extraction Report

**Target Folder:** `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing`

**Files Included:**
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts`
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.spec.ts`
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.html`
- `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.scss`

---

## 1. Test Types and Coverage

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test individual component methods (e.g., form patching, event handlers)
  - Validate form validation logic and error handling
  - Mock service calls and test API interaction logic
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test component interaction with child components and services
  - Validate form submission and state changes
- **UI/Template Tests:**
  - Test DOM rendering, bindings, and conditional UI elements

---

## 2. Test File Structure

- All tests are located in `registration-landing.component.spec.ts`
- Uses Jasmine and Angular TestBed for setup and assertions
- Mocks dependencies (services, router, etc.)

## 3. Test Requirements Mapping

| Requirement                        | Test Case(s)                                   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Form initializes with defaults      | Should create form with default values         |
| Form validation works              | Should mark form invalid for missing/invalid   |
| API calls on submit                | Should call addPerson/updatePerson on submit   |
| Error handling                     | Should display error messages on failure       |
| State changes reflected in UI      | Should update UI on state change               |
| Modal/dialog open/close            | Should open/close modal as expected            |

---

## 4. Test Patterns and Best Practices

- Uses spies and mocks for service dependencies
- Cleans up subscriptions and DOM after each test
- Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Tests both positive and negative scenarios

---

## 5. Rationale and Mapping to Requirements

- Test strategy ensures all business logic, UI, and API interactions are covered
- Follows DNA extraction checklist and rehydration guidance in `DOCS/system.prompt.md`
