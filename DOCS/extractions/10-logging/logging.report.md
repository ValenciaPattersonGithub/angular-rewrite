# Logging and Error Handling Details Report for `registration-landing`

_Context Source: `DOCS/extraction/extraction-report.md`_

## Overview

This report provides a detailed breakdown of all logging and error handling mechanisms in the `registration-landing` component, referencing all relevant files with complete relative paths from the workspace root. It follows the DNA extraction workflow and the requirements in `DOCS/system.prompt.md`.

---

## 1. What is Logged and Why?

- **User-facing notifications:**
  - Success and error messages are shown to users for all major operations (save, update, API failure).
  - Example (success):
    ```typescript
    this.toastrFactory.success(
      this.translate.instant(`Patient has been ${mode} successfully.`),
      this.translate.instant('Success')
    );
    // src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts
    ```
  - Example (error):
    ```typescript
    this.toastrFactory.error(
      this.translate.instant(`Unable to ${mode} patient.`),
      this.translate.instant('Server Error')
    );
    // src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts
    ```
- **Missing information:**
  - When form validation fails, a specific error message is shown:
    ```typescript
    this.toastrFactory.error('Unable to Save', 'Missing Information');
    // src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts
    ```
- **No console or file logging:**
  - There is no direct use of `console.log` or file-based logging in the component.

## 2. Messages and Their Context

- **Success:**
  - Displayed after a successful save or update operation.
  - Message is localized using `TranslateService`.
- **Error:**
  - Displayed when an API call fails or form validation fails.
  - Message is localized and user-friendly.
- **Context:**
  - All messages are triggered in response to user actions (save, update, navigation, validation).

---

## 3. Relationship to Business Logic, API, and Forms

- **API Operations:**
  - All API calls (add/update person) handle both success and error paths with user notifications.
- **Form Operations:**
  - Validation errors are surfaced to the user via error toasts.
- **Business Logic:**
  - Error handling is tightly coupled to business rules (e.g., required fields, duplicate checks).

---

## 4. Analytics and Monitoring Hooks

- **No explicit analytics or monitoring hooks** are present in the component code.
- **Potential for integration:**
  - The notification system could be extended to include analytics or monitoring (e.g., logging events to a service).

---

## 5. Implementation and Rationale

- **All logging and error handling is user-centric:**
  - Focus is on providing immediate, actionable feedback to the user.
  - No developer/debug logging is present in the component.
- **All code samples and logic are in:**
  - `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts`

## 6. File References
- Main logic: `src/patient/patient-registration/registration-landing/registration-landing.component.ts`
- Notification service: injected as `toastrFactory`
- Localization: injected as `TranslateService`
