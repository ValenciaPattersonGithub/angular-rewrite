# Input

I'm testing a theory. If a component is downgraded using downgradeComponent, it ceases to show up in storybook.
However, Button has both the .mdx and the .ts and the .ts file is showing up, but the .mdx is not.
So if creating this .mdx file for the checkbox allows the .ts to show up, then I have a workaround. And it's super weird.

## This is a false file

The theory is correct. If two files exist, the first file is skipped but the second file will show up. So as a workaround,
if a component has been downgraded, copy this .mdx file with the components' name and import and it will fix the missing story.
